                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>Quite soon after I was born in Pretoria, I was whisked away to Chicago, USA by my diplomat parents. This set a prece- dence for my childhood: I darted in and out of South Africa, living in both Switzerland and Ethiopia. Living this way has awarded me with a deep sense of reverence for all cultures, as well as a rather stubborn accent.</p>
                <p>From my first scribble with crayon on the backs of my father's official documents to my most recent game design project, I have always loved to create interesting artwork. Drawing, painting, reading, writing, and singing loudly in the shower are some of my hobbies. I've also enjoyed gaming ever since my parents attempted to distract me with a simple computer game as a toddler. This evolved into a desire to create beautiful three-dimensional environments of my own.</p>
                <p>I am energetic and confident in my ability to solve problems and overcome doubt. Vincent van Gogh once said, " If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced." I have decided that, in all walks of life, I will arm myself with a paintbrush.</p>
